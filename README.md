## LioKor JavaScript Education

**LKJSE** assists JS learning by classic algorithmic practice. It consists of task book (html select), code editor (Ace) and testing engine.

#### Tips:
* First function will be executed during checking. You may have other functions but they must be under the main one.
* "Run" button only evaluates all the written code with the eval(). So you need to call your function from your code and use alert() to debug.
* To see the reason of test failure - hover or touch the red test block.
* To see this text after check - change task.
* Your code is automatically saved to localStorage

#### Development and building
* Open terminal and navigate to project folder
* Install dependencies: ```yarn```
* To start dev server type ```yarn dev```
* To build: ```yarn build```
